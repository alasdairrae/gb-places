# Great Britain - Populated Places
A point file of populated places in Great Britain (from Ordnance Survey open data)

This repository contains a file with over 42,000 place names for populated places in Great Britain. I put it together using Ordnance Survey's OS Open Names data: https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-names.html

I've shared the shapefile, geopackage and geojson versions of the file here, in addition to a zipped QGIS project that you can just download and open.

In addition, if you look more closely at the various layer settings you'll see that I've included some filtering and data-driven styling, which you might find useful. See the screenshots folder in this repository for more on that.

You can show places with Welsh or Gaelic place names with this file, or all in English, depending upon your needs.

I hope you find this useful.
